- Small objects with a single, well-defined responsibility.
- Small methods that do only one thing.
- Limiting the number of types an object collaborates with.
- Strictly limiting the use of global state and singletons (that includes - limiting the use of class-level methods).
- Small object interfaces with simple method signatures.
- Preferring composition over inheritance.
