> The structure of a story
BDD provides a structure for a story. This is not mandatory – you can use a different story format and still be doing BDD – but I am presenting it here because it has been proven to work on many projects of all shapes and sizes. At the very least, your story should contain all of the elements described in the template. The story template looks like this:

> Title (one line describing the story)

> Narrative:
As a [role]
I want [feature]
So that [benefit]

> Acceptance Criteria: (presented as Scenarios)

> Scenario 1: Title
Given [context]
  And [some more context]...
When  [event]
Then  [outcome]
  And [another outcome]...

> Scenario 2: ...
