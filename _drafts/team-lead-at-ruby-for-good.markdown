I
When I signed up to attend [Ruby for Good](https://rubyforgood.org/) back in February I there was a spot on the form to indicate if you would be willing to be a team lead at the event. Not thinking much about it, I went ahead and checked the box and promptly forgot all about it. Fast forward to early May and imagine my surprise when I got a message on slack from Chris, one of the organizers, asking if I would be willing to be a co-lead on the [Demand Progress]()
